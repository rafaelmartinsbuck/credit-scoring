# Using Machine Learning to Credit Scoring

Banks and fintechs have a crucial role in modern economies and the people empowerment. For markets and society accelerate their activities, individuals and companies need access to credit.

A credit score is a numerical expression based on a level analysis of a person's credit records, to represent the creditworthiness of an individual. Traditionally, a credit score was primarily based on credit report information typically sourced from credit bureaus. However, with the proliferation of data science, institutions of any size can develop their credit scoring system and sharpen them for applications to their target markets.

The goal of this analysis is to build a model that borrowers can use to help make the best financial decisions.
